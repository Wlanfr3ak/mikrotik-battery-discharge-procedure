This is a very dirty Idea to measurement a Battery Status over Time with a old Mikrotik Board via Voltage Meter.

Step 1: 

/tool e-mail must be set correctly to send email,

/system ntp client must be set correctly for the correct time after a reboot,

/system identity should be set to identify the router in the Low Voltage Report,


Add the too Scripts AND edit the correct e-mail address in Scriptcode!!!
